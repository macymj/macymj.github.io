            While at school, film students should be sure to pay attention to their classes
            first and foremost. Students should take courses that will expand their mind,
            their craft, and their reel. I try to be on the lookout in particular courses that
            teach me new skills or strengthen my weak spots. <br>
            However, it should be noted that anyone can learn without classes, if need be. Online
            resources, practice, and exploration can teach a whole lot if you're dedicated enough.
            Personally, I taught myself to use Adobe Photoshop and it is still the program I know best. <br>
            I have found it ideal to build a schedule that gives me a good variety of skills and
            understandings. To do so, I double-majored in Communications with a concentration in Media
            Production and in Media and Journalism with a concentration in Advertising. I also minored
            in Global Cinema. Combined, my studies teach me all about creative production in both art
            and business, and film theory. I also take courses in writing, website coding, and public
            relations. <br>
            Along with classes, I believe you should get involved in campus groups. Especially at larger
            colleges, there are often groups dedicated to student creatives. At Carolina, Carolina Film
            Association and Student Television offer media makers a space and resources to start producing
            content they can add to their reel. Getting involved with other creative endeavors will also
            expand your resume and your mind. I worked at Playmakers making props for professional and student
            theater productions. <br>
            I also explored the organizational side of film by becoming the Junior Representative
            for Swain Lot Film Festival. Swain Lot is a student-run celebration of student film
            created here at UNC. <br>
            As you can see, there are plenty of options for learning opportunities at school, wherever
            you are. You just have to do your best to keep an open mind and busy schedule.
