             To the best of your ability, use your time at Carolina to travel.
             While here, grants, loans, and scholarships are available depending
             on where you want to go and what you want to do. <br>
             I worked at Sundance Film Festival in the 2019 year helping with theater
             operations and crowd service on a day to day basis. This allowed me not only
             the chance to see how festivals work behind the scenes and to see the latest
             artistic productions, but also to network with other film lovers and creators.<br>
             In order to gain international experience, I am studying abroad in the fall at
             King's College London. I will take film courses overseas to get a better understanding
             of film theory and film practice when I move away from the Hollywood convention.
             I can access classes that are not and would not be taught at UNC.
