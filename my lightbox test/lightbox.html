            The stars and all its powers,  are falling like the Himalayan roses, 
            For tonight the marble moon is on fire, 
            Just like the hazel flames in your eyes. 
            
            Soon, the Gemini shadows
                 will soar over.
            
            hallelujah .... hallelujah ... hallelujah
            
            As the world falls apart 
            like a red dress, 
            tell me the time, the time you felt life, 
            that life was good. 
            
            For the dirt storms and shadows, spirits 
            will eventually bleed above the sunrise. 
            Inside this truck, let me hold your heart. 
            below the shadows, I'll be your armor. 
            
            hallelujah .... hallelujah ... hallelujah
            
            Up and under the shirts, sleeves, of our feelings, 
            darkness doesn't feel so strange when I'm with you, 
            so hold and hang on the leg of my words,
            as the streetlights spill into the skin and memories. 
            
            Oh, the shadows, the shadows, the shadows, 
            I can feel fear as much as I feel the fire
            and the flames in your eyes, 
            the power of the earth moving like toddler and it's toy.
            
            Until we are clothed into one flame.
            Tell me you belong to me,
            There's just one more night,   
            For the marble moon is on fire. 
            
            Turn the radio on, the last song on high, 
            and let the flames of music blend 
            smoothly against the shadows light. 
            
            hallelujah .... hallelujah ... hallelujah
