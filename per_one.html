        <p>
            My name is Macy Jones and I'm a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
            I study Media Production, Advertising, and Global Cinema.

            I've had some exciting opportunities during my time here that help me to make the most of my student experience.
            To start with, I believe you should get involved in campus groups. Especially at larger colleges, there are often
            groups dedicated to student creatives. At Carolina, Carolina Film Association and Student Television offer media makers
            a space and resources to start producing content they can add to their reel. Getting involved with other creative
            endeavors will also expand your resume and your mind. I worked at Playmakers making props for professional and student
            theater productions.
