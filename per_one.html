        <p>             My name is Macy Jones and I'm a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
            I study Media Production, Advertising, and Global Cinema. <br>
            I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina and I chose to attend the University of North Carolina
            at Chapel Hill because of the quality education across the school. That way, I could feel confident
            studying a multitude of subject knowing that I would be learning from the best.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had some exciting opportunities during my time here that help me to make the most of my student experience.
            I believe that I can share my experience to help anyone else who may be wondering how to get the most of their
            own college days. <br>
